A static web page built utilizing a CSS framework of our choice. 

# Set-up
1. `fork` and `clone` repo
1. Open `index.html` in a browser window

# Framework Used
I used [Bulma](https://bulma.io), a CSS framework built on the CSS Flexbox spec. I built out a basic scaffolding of a landing page for a web app idea I've had.

### Why Bulma
I wanted to use a CSS framework I wasn't already familiar with, and Bulma is trending alongside React-specific CSS libraries such as Styled Components and the like. I
like the idea of a CSS framework built upon a foundation of the Flexbox spec.; it's versatile and promotes mobile-first design.

### Components Used
To accomplish this, I utilized the following components and elements:
* Navbar
* Hero
* Message
* Column layouts
* Containers
* Footer
* Form elements
